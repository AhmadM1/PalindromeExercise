# PalindromeExercise

1. Write a function that determines whether or not a word is a palindrome (a word that is spelled the same way both forwards and backwards). Please provide your results in one of these languages: JavaScript, Python, C++, C#, PHP.

2. Create a Github-Account (or use an existing one) and upload your results in a new repository.

3. Send the URL to your repository back to us.

# Example

```
is_palindrome("John") == false
is_palindrome("Hannah") == true
is_palindrome("Kiwik") == true
```
